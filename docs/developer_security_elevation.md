# Security Elevation in ServiceNow MCP

## Security Elevation

The Security Elevation tool provides the capability to temporarily elevate login session privileges by impersonating specific roles. This is particularly useful for performing administrative tasks that require elevated permissions such as `security_admin` or `admin` roles.

### Use Cases

- Temporary elevation to perform security-related administrative tasks
- Accessing restricted ServiceNow functionality that requires specific roles
- Testing role-based access controls
- Performing maintenance tasks that require elevated privileges

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| roles | string | Yes | Comma-separated list of roles to elevate to (e.g., 'security_admin', 'admin', 'itil') |

### Example

```python
# Example usage of security_elevation
result = security_elevation({
    "roles": "security_admin"
})

# Elevate to multiple roles
result = security_elevation({
    "roles": "security_admin,admin"
})
```

### Response

The tool returns a response with the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| success | boolean | Whether the operation was successful |
| message | string | A message describing the result |
| elevated_roles | string | The roles that were elevated to (null if elevation failed) |

### Security Considerations

- Role elevation should be used carefully and only when necessary
- Elevated privileges should be temporary and reverted when no longer needed
- Ensure you have the appropriate permissions to elevate to the requested roles
- Monitor and audit the use of role elevation in production environments

### Common Roles

Some commonly used roles for elevation include:

- `security_admin` - Security administrator role
- `admin` - Full administrative privileges
- `itil` - ITIL user role
- `user_admin` - User administration role
- `knowledge_admin` - Knowledge base administration

### Error Handling

The tool handles various error conditions:

- **Authentication errors**: When the user doesn't have permission to elevate
- **Invalid roles**: When the specified roles don't exist
- **Network errors**: When the ServiceNow instance is unreachable
- **HTTP errors**: Various HTTP status codes indicating different failure modes

### API Endpoint

This tool uses the ServiceNow UI Impersonate Role API:
- **Endpoint**: `/api/now/ui/impersonate/role`
- **Method**: POST
- **Content-Type**: `application/json`
